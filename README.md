vim-projectrc
=============

A tiny vim plugin to automatically load project-specific vimrc files. If vim is
opened from within the directory tree of a git repository, the files
{repodir}/.vimrc.team and {repodir}/.vimrc.local will be loaded, in that order.

Installation
------------

Copy by hand or install with a plugin manager like NeoBundle, etc.
